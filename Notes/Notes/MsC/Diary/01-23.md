Got my IDE setup, gonna try making a downloader for the model.

My laptop crashes when initializing the model, so any studies on the optimus model has to be done at my home PC. I will have to use a dummy low-weight model in the meantime just to understand pytorch.

For now:
```
deit_tiny_patch16_224
```

My model downloader works, time to learn how to use the models

Ok not deit_tiny, it was not available for fine-tuning, using this instead:
```
vit_tiny_patch16_224
```

Time to learn what the model functions are.
