So I made a script which summarized counts from the .xlsx file, but I misinterpreted the instruction and looked at the wrong tab, I summarized AOI counts instead of transcript counts, so I have to redo the task

I managed to use Daniels script to extract separate .tiff images of ROIs

Otherwise, the next task will be to make a script in QuPath that does cell segmentation for an ROI, export cell coordinates in the ROI, and then do that for every ROI

I managed to make a script that actually works now for summarizing counts, next step will be the cell segmentation script
