Playing around with the I2C script.

Data setup:
* In Image2Count/data/raw
* Create an experiment directory (i used 250630_TRIANGLE_3_Norway as you will see in the bash script)
* Place {label} in raw
* Place {measurements} in the experiment directory
* Create a train and test directory in experiment
* Put images of the cells in train and test

I managed to get image preprocessing running

****
<u>Contrastive learning</u>

For --train_image_mode, the argument --resnet_model in the readme is different from the argument in cellcontrast.py, its supposed to be --resnet

****

<u>Embedding</u>

* src.run.CellContrastEmbed function EmbedDataset is looking for a folder TMA1_preprocessed in the /raw directory, when is this formed?
Answer: its just a default value for the name of the folder containing cells.npy

* CellContrastEmbed, model = ContrastiveLearning
train_dataset get item requires that train_dataset, which is of type EmbedDataset, has an attribute data.  It is only initialized when save_embed_data is false. It is set to true when initialized.

How can it load data if it is set to true and requires false?
