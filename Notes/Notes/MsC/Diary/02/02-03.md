I forgot to transfer the data to my harddrive, so i cant test the i2c model

However, i got my lunarc log ins now. I will play around with the environment.

Marcus showed me how to use it, and i managed to run Daniels script that my laptop couldn't handle, so now i know how to use LUNARC!

Next step is to finish implementing my skeleton code for the foundation model. I have data, i have server access, so now it's just time to start coding
