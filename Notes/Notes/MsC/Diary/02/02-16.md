Haven't made a new entry in a long time, but I have been working i promise, just been using the prior note entry mostly

The embeddings now work, but i think i've stumbled upon a potential problem. The path_generator identifies different cells from the embeddings than qupath does, so the coordinates of the cells exported from qupath might not coincide. The distance measurements for the graph network might be invalid in that case.

Solution: the patch generator does extract centroids, so i can just make a new function that stores the coordinates in a new csv file.

I will however have to learn how the GAT network extracts these distances, if the 0,0 coordinate placement is essential.

I can just make the centroids become a yield, and these get appended in the same order as the results list, therefore the order is retained.
