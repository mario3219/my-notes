Another day another slay

So, everything is ready except for the fact that the preprocessor is handling cells in different order compared to the measurements.csv.

Markus suggested to loop through the csv instead of python region props.

Problem is, the preprocessor distorts the images so coordinates don't match up.

A solution would be to rescale the coordinates as well, or to make a translation index to show which cell in the csv the regionprops decided to handle.

If transforming:
* scale factor = shape before / shape after
* If padding is uniform, nothing should be done here
