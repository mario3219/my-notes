I found out i had access to alot more data than i thought

The code for formatting data was only made to handle one tif at a time, so i will have to change it to take several tifs at a time

This is now fixed, but i have to change some things form the normal I2C routine.

* The preprocessing requires global properties, but if you put some cells in training, and some other cells in testing, these cells needs to be preprocessed for the same global properties. The --preprocess dir therefore only takes an argument to lead to the directory containing train and test, so both can be scanned and collect images from the same source
* Some images has ROIs of different area sizes. When loading the data, the ROIs of smaller area are going to be zero padded.

Okay so i added zero padding, but now i got another problem, because i zero padded, the positions are gonna be shifted AGAIN, so ill have to move the process function outside the cell_seg loop into the loading data stage...

Thought process:
1. Iterate and find the largest width in image and mask
2. Scale the width and padding needed for the dataset
3. Use these values to initialize the data set
4. Load each data sample and its position
5. If needed, zero pad to appropriate size
6. Add the padding to the position
7. Pass the data and positions to preprocess

flatten loaded data so shapes fit
dask to handle large arrays

histogram solution instead loading everything, look at i2c preprocess

Scrap the above, new workflow using parallel computing
