Another day another slay

Showed the code, got some feedback
* Initializing empty data, use empty instead of zeros
* The mask is exported as RGB, with the different channels. It is more desirable for the image to be exported with one single channel, hard white and black to show where the cells are, almost binary
* The cell positions needs to be used from the csv file, so an introductory test would be to iterate through the csv file instead of the regionprops and return the positions from that instead, and then call the cutout functions.

<u>Questions</u>
* KMeans was present in CellContrastData, should i add this in DeepCellData aswell?
