Another day another slay

I'm trying to rescale the coordinates from the csv

This is how it looks like without rescaling positions

So after processing the image, the positions are misaligned.

But after scaling with the same factor for positions

It looks aligned

The same for the mask

when forming the scaling factor:
```
before = raw.shape[0]
raw = process(raw)
scale = before/raw.shape[0]
```
Gives more decimals than
`scale = mpp/dct_config.STANDARD_MPP_RESOLUTION`

Padding shifts the image as well

All ROI images tested can be found in out/position_scaling

Now i just need to figure out how to get only the cell boundaries and not every single detection
