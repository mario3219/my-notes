I've managed to write a script to get the cell positions now

What is left to do is to find a system for making the annotation names correctly (they differ from Daniels script, so all the csv refer to the ROIs differently)

**measurements.csv**
Refer to ROIs by the ROI image

**label.csv**
Refers to ROIs by the ROI image

So I need to make all the scripts refer to the image

All the scripts work perfectly as intended now
