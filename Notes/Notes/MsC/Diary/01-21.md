Today I will have to pick at least three foundation models. I will start with finding strong contenders, and narrowing it down to how easily I can access them.

So far I've found articles describing benchmarks of recent ViT models, and why they were developed in such ways. I've written down some strong contenders, but only investigated a few that were easy to access. Some models had some demanding requirements on the machine.
