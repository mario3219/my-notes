* Reducing the amount of results
Open up an example of a result, pick keywords that some publications use, and search once again using those keywords. Organize those *new* keywords under categories according to your original, for example "prevent" is similar to "reduce".

Includes more keywords, more results

* Truncation
Keep the root of the word, but remove endings and inflections
For example:
prevent*
mitigat*
forest fire*

* Phrase search
To keep phrases in exact order, for example
"forest fire*"
Otherwise, the search engine would lead to searching sentences with the words mixed, for example:
There is a forest and it is on fire

* Pick fields
Can make the search be specific to titles or authors

* After searching, refine results, use filters
