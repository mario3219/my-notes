**Process writing**
Raw-texts, messy notes, mind maps etc.
Good way to just start writing.

Maybe try not go into product writing immediately.

<u>Use free writing</u>
* Write for three minutes uninterrupted, underline good ideas and phrasings, repeat until you have a good working draft
* Good also to find gaps in data
