* Leave the text alone for a bit!
* Think of your reader
* Print out a physical copy
Also good to print out before sending something in, our eyes work differently with physical copies
* Ask someone to read
Maybe someone completely outside of the topic, not your supervisor, friends in the same program. Outsiders can give good input on clarity
* Ask for feedback
Could also ask your examiner!

* Keep thinking; if you add more, does the reader need this?
