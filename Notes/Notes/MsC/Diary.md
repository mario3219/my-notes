Introduction, managed to ask questions about the goal document and project plan, and further contextualize what the project is about. After further reading, I felt more grounded and comfortable around the topic, after which I continued writing my goal document with the added context.

More questions have now arisen:
* How do visual feature extractors get trained?
* How are they tailored to specific tasks?

I also learned that to learn more on how to move forward, I'm required to read more about the codebase, specifically to find where the visual feature backbone is incorporated. I will need dummy data to test my incorporated code. I will also need to study some foundation models, and how each of them works

After further research, I feel like I'm done with the first draft of the goal document, and the project plan. I will move onto reading about the codebase.
