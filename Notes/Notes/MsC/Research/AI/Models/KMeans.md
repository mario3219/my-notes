An unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups data points into k-clusters. K-means finds k centers and assigns each data point to the nearest one.

Initializes k-centroids (random positions) and assigns each point to the nearest centroid.

The iteration repositions the centroid and re-associates each data point to the nearest centroid. This continues until the distance is minimized.
