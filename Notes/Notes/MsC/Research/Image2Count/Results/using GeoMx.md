Performance metrics based on GeoMx ROI counts, and per ROI summed predictions of model runs.
Metrics were calculated on merged model predictions and the mean over all cross-validation folds.

Merged FFW Image2Count performed best on majority of metrics.
When filtering p<0.05 59/72 markers remained, some were more easily detected than others. Performance was therefore marker dependent. For the rest of this section, this model was used.

**Cell specific expressions**
Predicted cell expressions matched with true in a lot of cases, some expressions negatively correlated with other expressions, indicating that the model learned to distinguish between immune cells and fibroblasts. The expected locations for predictions matched, so the model correctly predicted tissue boundaries.
The model however failed to discriminate between T-cell types.

And so on talking about how specific tissues and cells were predicted...
