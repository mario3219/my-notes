Visually overlayed cell expressions on top of images. Additionally, cell expressions were correlated with pseudo ROI sizes from the multi-plex datasets (meaning that ROI bulk data was created for the multi-cell images, to compare performance when using bulk data)

The comparison of performance was done with three different models.
* A linear prediction head called ResNet for simplicity
* Image2Count consisting of purely residual FFW networks
* Image2Count utilizing residual graph convolutions with attention (GAT)
* FFW networks which used the constructed cell graph from SimCLR
