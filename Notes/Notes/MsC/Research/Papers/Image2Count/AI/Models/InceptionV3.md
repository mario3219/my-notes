A CNN model. Each layer forms blocks instead, of several convolution paths. The path output with most influence decides the outcome.

The network captures fine details and coarser patterns simultaneously.

"InceptionV3 is a convolutional neural network that uses parallel multi-scale convolutional paths with factorized filters and 1×1 bottlenecks to achieve high accuracy with efficient computation."
