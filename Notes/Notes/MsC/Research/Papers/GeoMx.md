So as I understand it...

* Various fluorescent antibodies attach to different tissue, which illuminate under UV-light
* Various fluorescent markers highlight different morphological features
* This is how you get a visual of an ROI
* You can mask the UV-light to see specific marker fluorescence in an area inside the ROI, this is AOI (area of illumination)
* For getting the counts, UV-lights illuminate Barcoded oligonucleotides. The barcodes are connected with photocleavable linkers. So when exposed by light, they release.
* Released barcodes are collected and counted, this is how you can count proteins or RNAs in an ROI
