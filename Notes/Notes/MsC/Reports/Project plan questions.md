* Ideas for what could be the different "steps" of the project that can be divided into time spans?
pick 3 foundation models
see how to get access
incorporate in with i2c
experiment with dummy data
switch to real data
analyze data

incorporation step:
march april
access to foundation models:

* When should the project to be considered as "ended" and report writing should start?
two weeks before done, only writing, preferably programs, last month at writing
* Any dates that will lead to extended periods of competing activities?

* What type of supervision should we have? Scheduled meetings, meeting when needed?
* Perhaps include a set meeting for progress report?
