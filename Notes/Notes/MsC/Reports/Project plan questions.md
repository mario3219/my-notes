* Ideas for what could be the different "steps" of the project that can be divided into time spans?
* When should the project to be considered as "ended" and report writing should start?
* Any dates that will lead to extended periods of competing activities?
* What type of supervision should we have? Scheduled meetings, meeting when needed?
* Perhaps include a set meeting for progress report?
