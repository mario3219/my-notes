What needs to be done:
* Find the relative arguments from Image2Count, match it to input to foundation model, optimize output of foundation model to work with Image2Count
* Find out how to fine-tune the frozen parameters
* Find out how to just get Image2Count running
* Fix a repository of dummy images, using a .tiff file generator
* Find out how to store the model locally

**Workplan**

<u>For foundation model</u>
****
* Find out how to store model locally
* Find out how to fine tune model

<u>For Image2Count</u>
* Dummy single-layer visual feature model to replace ResNet in Image2C
Just to find out what arguments to take and output
* Find out what steps are being performed for an image
i.e if its just straight into training and predicting

<u>Other</u>
****
* Dummy .tiff file generator
* Fix conda environment
