Least squares or maximum likelihood, two approaches of optimizing parameters

Maximum-likelihood is built with the approach of the likelihood of observing y given theta and x.
The approach uses optimization where the likelihood of observing y given x is at its highest,
which means that observations x are highly tied to y.

The closed form solution stems from the cost function $e(n)=y-\hat{y}$. By using the log form, the solution becomes parabolical.
