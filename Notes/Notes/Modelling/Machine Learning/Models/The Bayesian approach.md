Normally we have a frequentist view on parameters, where parameters are unknown, but fixed.

The Bayesian approach treats parameters as random stochastic variables, which changes with data.

Almost any model can be made bayesian

* Uncertainty built into the model
* Works well with small data
* Sequential updating, posterior today becomes prior tomorrow

* Often need approximations
* Bad priors bias results
* Strong priors can dominate data
* Computationally heavy

Kalman filter is bayesian by nature!
