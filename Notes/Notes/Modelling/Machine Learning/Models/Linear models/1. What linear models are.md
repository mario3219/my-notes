Linear models is a family of models that share the same geometric idea, being that they share linear outputs with inputs.

**Linear regressors**
Uses the hyperplane as the predictor surface

**Linear classifiers**
Uses the hyperplane as a decision boundary

For regression: prediction is the mean of past data
For classification: The most occurring class
