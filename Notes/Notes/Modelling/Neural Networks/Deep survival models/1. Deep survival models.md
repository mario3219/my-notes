Models that predict time-to-event outcomes, meaning how long it takes until something happens.

Formed using base neural networks, and then a survival layer as the prediction head, using an appropriate survival loss.

**Data**
Feature data, with another column observed time, and event indicator.

The interesting point is when the probability for both outcomes are equal, defined as $S(t|x)$.

**Hazard function**
A transformation of $S(t|x)$, which shows the instantaneous rate of death conditioned on surviving up to time t for raw input x. Shows the probability of an event happening within a short period of time, given the condition that the event hasn't happened yet.

Different scaling options exist, to emphasize different risk factors.

"oh so there is a different function afterwards, that I put in the result from the survival model, and that function then tells me the risk probabilities over time?"
