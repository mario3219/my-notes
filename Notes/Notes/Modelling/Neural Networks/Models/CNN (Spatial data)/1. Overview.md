CNN preserve spatial information by representing the input variables as matrices, compared to inputting all the structure in a vector, losing spatial information. By using a matrix, spatial structure is retained.

Zero padding is used along the borders.
Fairly insensitive to translations.

A convolutional layer also reduces amount of parameters. In a dense layer, imagine if all pixels were associated with their own weights. That would be one weight for each pixel.
In a convolutional layer, the sliding filter uses the same weights all the time, no matter the position.
