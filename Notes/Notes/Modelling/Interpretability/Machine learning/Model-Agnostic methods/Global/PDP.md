Partial dependence plot.

![[Pasted image 20260112161713.png]]

Holds all features constant, and slides the feature to be investigated through a range of values. If the plot is flat, then it has low significance.

**Disadvantages**
* Unrealistic for dependent features
* Maximum number of two features for plotting reasons
* Describes the model, but not necessarily the world
