Accumulated Local effects. Problem with PDP was that the range of values to be tested with usually was unrealistic, as the combinations of data might not be realistic.

ALE lets the feature wiggle locally, and change all other feature values to the closest datapoint that is coupled with that feature value to be tested. The prediction differences are integrated, thus cumulative.
