Shows feature interactions. If feature j is independent of the rest, the H-statistic is zero, and if interaction describes the entire prediction, the H-statistic is one.

**Workflow**
Calculate joint PDP's and independent PDP's, then form the interaction functions using those PDP's. If there is no interaction, then the term is 0.
