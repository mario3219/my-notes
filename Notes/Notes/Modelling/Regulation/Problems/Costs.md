An aging population, new technology, expanded treatment options, a population that places new demands on caregivers. These are some of the underlying reasons.

**Administrative costs**
Administrative information has not been used together with healthcare information

**<u>Healthcare decisions have mostly been based on care logic</u>****

**Budgets**
Budgets are calculated as average cost-per-patient KPP for each diagnosis group DRG, with weights affecting how much a patient contributes to the costs.

This however does not reflect reasonable or acceptable cost for the patient´, nor does it reflect effectiveness or cost.

"Självkostnadskalkyl" which is mentioned in the lecture is a more direct and individual approach of calculating the costs, using all aspects that go into the care of the patient.

**Costs differ per region**
**No distinction is made between direct or indirect costs**
**Costs are usually only describing care for a visit or session** and not for the entire care chain. Problem is that most costs locally are described using KPP.

**Time driven activity based costing TDABC**
Based on resources that are actually available and possible production capacity, useful to find occupied resources without meaningful impact.
