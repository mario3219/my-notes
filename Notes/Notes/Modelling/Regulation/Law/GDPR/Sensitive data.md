GDPR defines personal data as information relating to a person, meaning information that can be used to identify a person.

GDPR separates personal data and special personal data, which are designated as "sensitive personal data", which regulations are more restrictive for. GDPR contains special legal grounds that enable processing of personal data. Even though sensitive data is handled, legislation is still articulated in a technology neutral way.

**Pseudonymization**
Data is stored under a different actor. Regarding GDPR, this is still protected information under legislation.
