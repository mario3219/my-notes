The computer still struggles nowadays, not completely reliable yet.

For example in AF screening, where missing an important case is deemed unacceptable, and too many false alarms may cause problems for the healthcare system.

AF screening involves:
* Type of population
* Continuous or intermittent recordings
* Active or non-active groups
* Attachment to the body
* Types of noise
* Standard leads or specialized leads
* At home or in hospital

The main challenge is not to separate AF from SR, but rather:
* To handle complicated mix of all possible rhythm deviations
* Activity that leads to irregularities
* Poor measurements that lead to problems with QRS detections
