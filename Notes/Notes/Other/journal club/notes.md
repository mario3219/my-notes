**Background**
Assess prognostic role of B cells in ccRCC
**Methods**
Spatial transcriptomics, mIF, immunohistochemistry to investigate B localization and suppressive functionality. ML to derive B signature to validate risk stratification and immune profiling.
**Results**
Elevated B observed in ccRCC, associated with advanced T stage, higher tumor grades, decreased *progression-free survival* (measures time of survival after treatment and disease not worsening)

Spatial transcriptomics revealed that (some markers) exert immunosuppressive effects, with or without *tertiary lymphoid structures* (immune cell hubs that form in non-lymphoid tissues during inflammation)

ML comprised 16 B genes, binary classification. ML score was linked to upregulated IL-10, TGF-$\beta$ production, suppression of lymphocyte activation, yadayada. High score=bad, worse clinical outcome, high correlation was found for IRF4 for outcome, and correlating with IL-10 and PDCD1 expression. Higher score patients exhibits poor response to immunotherapy.

**Introduction**
RCC typically originates in epithelial cells of renal tubules, ccRCC a subtype, 75-80% of all subtypes. Primarily managed through *nephrectomy* (surgical removal) advanced metastatic treatment through inhibitors, but advanced stage face resistance and treatment failure.

Typically Bregs in B cells has shown low prognostic value based on signature, but not alot of studies on the mechanisms they facilitate on ccRCC. 

****

* Model-agnostic methods to investigate more feature correlations for score, not only linear coefficients
* Interesting to see time-of-event data, C-index concordant for similar risk profiles. C-index very similar, would consider alternative scoring
* ML algorithms, try higher complexity, SALMON
*
